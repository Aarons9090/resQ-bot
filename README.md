# ResQ Bot
#### For educational purposes only! I do not recommend the use of this program.
This bot will search ResQ web app for the selected item and buy it if it appears.

## Why?
In my area there is a huge competition on getting that sweet loot bag from K-Market. I always lose that battle. Safe to say I don't like losing.

## Solution?
A Python Selenium script that scans my area for the selected item and buys it if it's available.

## Instructions

#### 1. Clone repo
#### 2. Install dependencies
#### 3.  Update chromedriver if necessary
#### 4. Create .env file and store your login info as

> PASSWORD=""
#### 5. Enter the product to find in  "OFFER_TO_FIND" 
#### 6. Make sure that your ResQ account has credits
#### 7. Make room in your fridge/freezer
